# Miniprotein stability from Sequence 

Project part of the [2021 Copenhagen Protein Biohackathon](https://biohackathon.biolib.com/event/2021-protein-edition/). 

We participated in the challenge `Predicting multi mutant miniprotein stability`

Our team name is MARS (**M**iniprotein st**A**bility f**R**om Sequence) ðŸŒ•


We built a convolutional Variational Autoencoder architecture using PyTorch to tackle the task of predicting miniprotein stability from sequence using the dataset by Rocklin et.al. Science 2017.

The idea is to learn a lower dimensional embedding of the miniprotein sequence space in the latent dimension from which the original sequence can reconstructed or from which new sequences can be sampled. Additionally, a prediction task is used to predict the stability score of the miniproteins from the learned embedding in the latent space.

This architecture has the advantage that one can sample sequences around a sequence of interest for which one knows or has predicted that it has high stability.

A sketch of the architecture is as follows:

The results for the single and multi mutant dataset are as follows:

# using a onehot encoded sequence
Each sequence is encoded using one hot encoding with 3 extra entries to denote secondary structure
- Single mutants Rp 0.72 Spearman 0.73 p<0.00001
- Multi mutants Rp 0.47 Spearman 0.35 p<0.00001

# embedding the input sequence using ProtTransBertBFD
 Single mutants Rp 0.80 Spearman 0.81 p<0.00001
